# refactorme

This is a dotnet core 2 project. You can use Visual Studio or VS Code. 

This is a default project but I have added a file wilks.cs

In my sport of powerlifting, to judge how strong you are relative to people with different body weight or gender we run it through a formula called the Wilks Coefficient. It allows us to see relative strength. 

I would like you to create a simple page using ASP MVC to allow users to
1) Enter a total weight lifted i.e. 400 (meaning 400 kg)
2) Enter a bodyweight
3) Choose male or female 
4) Run the bodyweight and gender through the CalculateWilks method
5) Multiply the coefficient from #4 with the total weight in #1
5) display the result

Note that I have intentionally introduced a few minor errors.
